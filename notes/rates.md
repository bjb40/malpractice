#Overview#

This is just to note a number of models using malpractice rates (with moving population as the denominator) and rates of complication deaths.

#Summary#

Rates have negative associations with one another (in both directions). Cap affects only malpractice rate (and only the difference, not the difference in means). The issue here is two-fold: (1) small cell sizes makes rates uncertain (a Bayesian model can work it; there is an example in demography) and the nb model is unstable with the rates; (2) the denominator for the malpractice rate is tricky because of the lag issue. A better analysis would be to take 3, 5, and 10 year rates of conversion from all deaths to malpractice. As written, the draft working paper is inaccurate. Population needs accounted for in a better way.

Current positive associations, as written, are a function of changes in population. Conditional on population, the trend in both directions is negative. Dividing across mean levels and difference levels in rates suggest opposite influences, potentially (though the f/e effect is negative). Specifically the mean rate is negative from malpractice rate to rate; the difference is positive. Specifically, consistently high levels of malpractice rates in a state are associated with lower levels of deaths due to medical complications. However, short-term changes in malpractice rates are associated with higher levels of deaths due to medical complicaitons (defensive medicine). In contrast, the higher rates of deaths due to complications (poor safety) are associated with lower malpractice rates (does not show connection with patient safety!). However, none of these are statistically significant and the small cell sizes make it very sensitive to outliers. These are based on a few random effects with slope models.

The value-add in my expertise is to take time and calculate the rates ... (and make them publicly available). I can also address the assumptions in Frakes 2014 more particularly.
