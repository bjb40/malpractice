Explanations for changes in payouts/claims: (1) tort reform, (2) health care quality, (3) Rising litigation costs, (4) more hospital-employed physicians, (5) NPDB and settlement, (6) changes in personal injury clais in general



2. Improvements in Health-Care Quality
If the rate of health-care errors drops, or the errors become more subtle and harder to recover damages for, the rate of malpractice claims should drop as well. Most errors do not lead to claims, but most claims do involve errors, and adverse event rates and malpractice rates are correlated.25 Unfortunately, although there have been improvements in healthcare quality in some areas (e.g., a decline in central-line-associated bloodstream infections in intensive care units), studies of error rates continue to show distressingly high rates, with no overall evidence of improvement.26 Thus, improvements in health-care quality are unlikely to explain our results.
3. Rising Litigation Costs
The cost of defending med mal claims is rising over time. For example, in Texas, real defense costs roughly doubled from 1988 to 2004, even though payouts were roughly
25On most errors not leading to claims, see the review by Baker (2005). On most claims involving errors, often negligent errors, see Studdert et al. (2006). On the correlation between adverse patient safety events and malpractice claim rates, see Greenberg et al. (2010) and Black and Zabinski (2013).
