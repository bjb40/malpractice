#Overview

A few years ago, the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies published some (primarily) desriptive stats on changes in medmal claims [@paik_receding_2013]. The article looked at rates (usually relative to physicians), and noted general declines in payouts for medical malpractice. Explanations for changes in payouts/claims: (1) tort reform, (2) health care quality, (3) Rising litigation costs, (4) more hospital-employed physicians (hospitals pay instead of physicians, declining the amount of payments), (5) NPDB and settlement, (6) changes in personal injury claims in general.

I am interested in two concepts: improvements (or lack thereof) in health care quality and in defensive medicine. I can gloss these with medicalization concepts from the second year paper and add an aging component without too much trouble (initial thoughts are in the note entitled "Preliminary analysis and data" (prelim_code...)). This memo provides an overview of the legal research on these terms, primarily through the jumping point outlined in this JELS article [@paik_receding_2013].

#Summary

##Health Care Quality

Medical care does produce errors, but most errors do not lead to legal claims [@baker_medical_2005]. However, most legal claims do involve errors (though 37% did not in this study) [@studdert_claims_2006]. Using a sample of claims from California (using county fixed effects), researchers associated with RAND have identified a strong negative correlation between increased patient safety indicators (PSI) (as reported by hospital adverse events) and decreased malpractice claims [@greenberg_is_2010]. A similar data strategy is employed by Black and Zabinski in Texas and Florida [@black_association_2015] make similar findings using hospital and county fixed effects regarding claim rates (this is a working paper on SSRN, not sure if it is published, yet). This study also makes adjustments for truncated data and medical malpractice (should look at that in more deatail). These provide a perfect hook for statewide analysis of paid claims (relative to some sensible lag in causes of death due to "complications" or physician error).

Error rates are high with respect to medicine [@classen_global_2011; @landrigan_temporal_2010; @farmer_tension_2013]

```analyze cause of death paper you ran into from 2016 that suggests 1/3 of all deaths are the result of medical care error```

##Defensive Medicine

Two major definitions of defensive medicine and the key original studies are outlined in an article which seeks to identify medical costs related to medical malpractice litigation [@mello_national_2010].
