	abstract = {As causes of death, influenza and pneumonia are typically analyzed together. We quantify influenza’s contribution to the combined pneumonia and influenza mortality time series for the United States, 1959–2009. A key statistic is I/(P+I), the proportion of pneumonia and influenza mortality accounted for by influenza. Year-to-year, I/(P+I) is highly variable and shows long-term decline. Extreme values of I/(P+I) are associated with extreme P+I death rates and vice-versa, but I/(P+I) is a weak predictor of P+I mortality overall. Prominence of influenza in the medical news is associated with high I/(P+I). Influenza and pneumonia should be analyzed as a combined cause.},

	abstract = {Social scientists and other analysts have written about medicalization since at least the 1970s. Most of these studies depict the medical profession, interprofessional or organizational contests, or social movements and interest groups as the prime movers toward medicalization. This article contends that changes in medicine in the past two decades are altering the medicalization process. Using several case examples, I argue that three major changes in medical knowledge and organization have engendered an important shift in the engines that drive medicalization: biotechnology (especially the pharmaceutical industry and genetics), consumers, and managed care. Doctors are still gatekeepers for medical treatment, but their role has become more subordinate in the expansion or contraction of medicalization. Medicalization is now more driven by commercial and market interests than by professional claims-makers. The definitional center of medicalization remains constant, but the availability of new pharmaceutical and potential genetic treatments are increasingly drivers for new medical categories. This requires a shift in the sociological focus examining medicalization for the twenty-first century.},

Researchers have studied the impact of these caps, relative to control states without caps, but have not studied trends in no-cap states or overall national trends. We find that the per-physician rate of paid med mal claims has been dropping for 20 years and in 2012 was less than half the 1992 level. Lawsuit rates, in the states with available data, are also declining, at similar rates. “Small” paid claims (payout {\textless} \$50,000 in 2011 dollars) have been dropping for the full period; “large” paid claims (payout ≥ \$50,000) have been dropping since 2001. Payout per large paid claim was roughly flat. Payouts per physician have been dropping since 2003, and by 2012 were 48 percent below their 1992 level. The “third wave” of damage cap adoptions over 2003–2006 contributed to this trend, but there are also large declines in no-cap states.},

	abstract = {Objective: To compare two methods for identifying adverse events using routinely recorded hospital abstract data in all public and private hospitals in Victoria, Australia.
Methods: Secondary analysis of data on all admissions in the period 1 July 2000–30 June 2001 (n = 1,645,992) to estimate the rates of adverse events using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision Australian Modification codes alone and in combination with an 'incidence' data flag indicating complicating diagnoses which arise after hospitalization; rates of incidence and pre-existing adverse events, and rates for same-day and multi-day admissions.
Results: In total, 8\% of all admissions were recorded with an adverse event. Use of {ICD} codes alone identified only 59\% of the events identified using the combined method, giving a prevalence rate of only 5\%. Incident cases, that is, those occurring in the index admission, represented 68\% of identified adverse events. The adverse events incidence rate for multi-day admissions was significantly higher at 12\%, compared with the same day rate of 0.4\%.
Conclusion: An 'incidence flag' is essential to identify those adverse events for which a hospital has unambiguous responsibility. Using such a flag, secondary analysis of administrative data can provide hospital quality assurance programmes with a comprehensive view of all adverse events (not just 'sentinel' events) at a reasonable cost and with more timely results than more intensive methods can achieve. Although the method is likely to underestimate the true rate of adverse events (in particular, by not capturing adverse events which only manifest after discharge), in this study of Australian hospitals, rates of adverse events were found to be similar to those derived from studies using manual review of patient records.},

We find strong correlations among most {PSIs}:  hospitals with high rates on one {PSI} usually have high rates on other {PSIs}.  We also find a strong association between {PSI} rates and med mal claim rates.  A pooled measure of {PSI} rates predicts higher claim rates in hospital fixed effects specifications (in Florida) and county-fixed effects specifications (in Texas).  Our results suggest that, contrary to the views of many health care providers, med mal claims that lead to payouts are not a random event.  Instead, hospitals that improve patient safety can reduce med mal payouts.We also study local variation in patient safety, in the spirit of the Dartmouth Atlas work on variation in treatment intensity.  We find large variations, both across counties and across hospitals within counties.  This suggests that many adverse hospital events are avoidable at reasonable cost, since some hospitals are avoiding them.},

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool found at least ten times more confirmed, serious events than these other methods. Overall, adverse events occurred in one-third of hospital admissions.

Standards are ubiquitous but underappreciated tools for regulating and organizing social life in modernity, and they lurk in the background of many sociological works. Reviewing the relevance of standards and standardization in diverse theoretical traditions and sociological subfields, we point to the emergence and institutionalization of standards, the difficulties of making standards work, resistance to standardization, and the multiple outcomes of standards. Rather than associating standardization with totalizing narratives of globalization or dehumanization, we call for careful empirical analysis of the specific and unintended consequences of different sorts of standards operating in distinct social domains.},

Applying empirical Bayes methods in a regression setting, we construct a predictor of each physician's underlying propensity to incur malpractice claims. Our explanatory factors are physician demographics (age, sex, specialty, training) and physician practice pattern characteristics (practice setting, procedures performed, practice intensity, special risk factors, and characteristics of hospital(s) on staff of). We divide physicians into medical and surgical/ancillary specialty categories and fit separate models to each. In the surgical/ancillary specialty group, physician characteristics can effectively distinguish between more and less claims-prone physicians. Physician characteristics have somewhat less predictive power in the medical specialty group. As measured by predictive information, physician characteristics are superior to 10 years of claims history. Insofar as medical malpractice claims can be thought of as extreme indicators of poor-quality care, this finding suggests that easily gathered physician characteristics can be helpful in designing targeted quality of care improvement policies.},

This method—which has been implemented in both Stata and {LIMDEP}—does not in fact control for all stable covariates. Three alternative methods are explored. A negative multinomial model yields the same estimator as the conditional Poisson estimator and hence does not provide any additional leverage for dealing with overdispersion. On the other hand, a simulation study yields good results from applying an unconditional negative binomial regression estimator with dummy variables to represent the fixed effects. There is no evidence for any incidental parameters bias in the coefficients, and downward bias in the standard error estimates can be easily and effectively corrected using the deviance statistic. Finally, an approximate conditional method is found to perform at about the same level as the unconditional estimator.},

	title = {Does Medical Malpractice Law Improve Health Care Quality?},
	url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w19841},
	abstract = {Despite the fundamental role of deterrence in justifying a system of medical malpractice law, surprisingly little evidence has been put forth to date bearing on the relationship between medical liability forces on the one hand and medical errors and health care quality on the other. In this paper, we estimate this relationship using clinically validated measures of health care treatment quality constructed with data from the 1979 to 2005 National Hospital Discharge Surveys and the 1987 to 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System records. Drawing upon traditional, remedy-centric tort reforms–e.g., damage caps–we estimate that the current liability system plays at most a modest role in inducing higher levels of health care quality. We contend that this limited independent role for medical liability may be a reflection upon the structural nature of the present system of liability rules, which largely hold physicians to standards determined according to industry customs. We find evidence suggesting, however, that physician practices may respond more significantly upon a substantive alteration of this system altogether–i.e., upon a change in the clinical standards to which physicians are held in the first instance. The literature to date has largely failed to appreciate the substantive nature of liability rules and may thus be drawing limited inferences based solely on our experiences to date with damage-caps and related reforms.},

	abstract = {Abstract An important objective of medical liability law is to deter medical errors by punishing negligent mistakes. However, relatively little evidence exists on the deterrence effect. Using newly constructed measures of preventable medical complications and state tort reforms in the United States between 1994 and 2007, I find evidence that higher liability pressure deters preventable medical complications associated with four specific obstetric and gynecologic procedures. The results also show that the effects of tort reforms vary according to the specific reform in question. While joint and several liability reform (which increases doctor accountability) appears to decrease preventable medical complications, collateral source rule reform and caps on punitive damages appear to increase these complications. Opponents of tort reform often argue that tort reforms may adversely affect patient safety, and the results of this paper suggest that such a concern is legitimate.},

Growth in malpractice payments contributed at most 5\% points to the 33\% total real growth in medical expenditures from 1990 to 2003. On the other hand, malpractice leads to modest mortality reductions; the value of these more than likely exceeds the costs of malpractice liability. Therefore, reducing malpractice liability is unlikely to have a major impact on health care spending, and unlikely to be cost-effective over conventionally accepted values of a statistical life.},

	abstract = {Study question Is a higher use of resources by physicians associated with a reduced risk of malpractice claims?
Methods Using data on nearly all admissions to acute care hospitals in Florida during 2000-09 linked to malpractice history of the attending physician, this study investigated whether physicians in seven specialties with higher average hospital charges in a year were less likely to face an allegation of malpractice in the following year, adjusting for patient characteristics, comorbidities, and diagnosis. To provide clinical context, the study focused on obstetrics, where the choice of caesarean deliveries are suggested to be influenced by defensive medicine, and whether obstetricians with higher adjusted caesarean rates in a year had fewer alleged malpractice incidents the following year.
Study answer and limitations The data included 24 637 physicians, 154 725 physician years, and 18 352 391 hospital admissions; 4342 malpractice claims were made against physicians (2.8\% per physician year). Across specialties, greater average spending by physicians was associated with reduced risk of incurring a malpractice claim. For example, among internists, the probability of experiencing an alleged malpractice incident in the following year ranged from 1.5\% (95\% confidence interval 1.2\% to 1.7\%) in the bottom spending fifth (\$19 725 (£12 800; €17 400) per hospital admission) to 0.3\% (0.2\% to 0.5\%) in the top fifth (\$39 379 per hospital admission). In six of the specialties, a greater use of resources was associated with statistically significantly lower subsequent rates of alleged malpractice incidents. A principal limitation of this study is that information on illness severity was lacking. It is also uncertain whether higher spending is defensively motivated.
What this study adds Within specialty and after adjustment for patient characteristics, higher resource use by physicians is associated with fewer malpractice claims.

In a linked paper in this issue, Jena and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj.h5516) examine a longstanding, unanswered question about the {US} malpractice system: if doctors spend more, will they reduce their risk of being sued?1 This is an important question that explores the contentious issues of defensive medicine and the risk of malpractice claims in the {US} healthcare system.

Defensive medicine refers to medical care performed primarily to reduce the risk of litigation. Positive defensive medicine occurs when doctors perform more tests or procedures than are necessary. Negative defensive medicine occurs when doctors avoid high risk procedures or refuse to care for high risk patients. Most doctors in the United States state that they practise defensive medicine, and it is estimated that \$60b (£39b; €54b) is spent annually on defensive medicine.2 3 Although the {US} is considered a highly litigious environment, clinicians in other countries also report practising defensively.4

Using birth certificate data from the Natality Detail Files and state-level data from publicly available sources, this study analyzes the effects of tort laws on labor induction with multilevel models ({MLM}) of 665,491 early-term births nested in states. Results reveal that caps on damages are associated with significantly higher odds of early-term induction and Proportionate Liability ({PL}) is associated with significantly lower odds compared to Joint and Several Liability ({JSL}). The findings suggest that clinicians are more likely to engage in practices that defy professional guidelines in tort environments with lower legal burdens.

This transdisciplinary model adds scientific practices to the lawyerly functions of normative and doctrinal research, counseling, and representation. These practices include policy surveillance and empirical public health law research on the efficacy of legal interventions and the impact of laws and legal practices on health and health system operation.

We examine analytically the respective omitted-variable and simultaneity biases of nonspatial {OLS} and spatial {OLS} in the simplest case and then evaluate the performance of all four estimators in bias, efficiency, and {SE} accuracy terms under more realistic conditions using Monte Carlo experiments. We provide empirical illustration, showing how to calculate and present spatial effect estimates effectively, using data on European governments' active labor market expenditures. Our main conclusions are that spatial {OLS}, despite its simultaneity, performs acceptably under low-to-moderate interdependence strength and reasonable sample dimensions. Spatial 2SLS or spatial {ML} may be advised for other conditions, but, unless interdependence is truly absent or minuscule, any of the spatial estimators unambiguously, and often dramatically, dominates on all three criteria the nonspatial {OLS} commonly used currently in empirical work in political science.},
