	abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the conditional negative binomial model for panel data, proposed by Hausman, Hall, and Griliches (1984), is not a true fixed–effects method. This method—which has been implemented in both Stata and {LIMDEP}—does not in fact control for all stable covariates. Three alternative methods are explored. A negative multinomial model yields the same estimator as the conditional Poisson estimator and hence does not provide any additional leverage for dealing with overdispersion. On the other hand, a simulation study yields good results from applying an unconditional negative binomial regression estimator with dummy variables to represent the fixed effects. There is no evidence for any incidental parameters bias in the coefficients, and downward bias in the standard error estimates can be easily and effectively corrected using the deviance statistic. Finally, an approximate conditional method is found to perform at about the same level as the unconditional estimator.},

Our safety measures are 17 adult Patient Safety Indicators ({PSIs}) – measures developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of adverse events, many of which are avoidable.  We find strong correlations among most {PSIs}:  hospitals with high rates on one {PSI} usually have high rates on other {PSIs}.  We also find a strong association between {PSI} rates and med mal claim rates.  A pooled measure of {PSI} rates predicts higher claim rates in hospital fixed effects specifications (in Florida) and county-fixed effects specifications (in Texas).  Our results suggest that, contrary to the views of many health care providers, med mal claims that lead to payouts are not a random event.  Instead, hospitals that improve patient safety can reduce med mal payouts.We also study local variation in patient safety, in the spirit of the Dartmouth Atlas work on variation in treatment intensity.  We find large variations, both across counties and across hospitals within counties.  This suggests that many adverse hospital events are avoidable at reasonable cost, since some hospitals are avoiding them.},

We compared three methods to detect adverse events in hospitalized patients, using the same patient sample set from three leading hospitals. We found that the adverse event detection methods commonly used to track patient safety in the United States today—voluntary reporting and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Patient Safety Indicators—fared very poorly compared to other methods and missed 90 percent of the adverse events. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool found at least ten times more confirmed, serious events than these other methods.

	abstract = {Objective: To compare two methods for identifying adverse events using routinely recorded hospital abstract data in all public and private hospitals in Victoria, Australia.
Methods: Secondary analysis of data on all admissions in the period 1 July 2000–30 June 2001 (n = 1,645,992) to estimate the rates of adverse events using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision Australian Modification codes alone and in combination with an 'incidence' data flag indicating complicating diagnoses which arise after hospitalization; rates of incidence and pre-existing adverse events, and rates for same-day and multi-day admissions.
Results: In total, 8\% of all admissions were recorded with an adverse event. Use of {ICD} codes alone identified only 59\% of the events identified using the combined method, giving a prevalence rate of only 5\%. Incident cases, that is, those occurring in the index admission, represented 68\% of identified adverse events. The adverse events incidence rate for multi-day admissions was significantly higher at 12\%, compared with the same day rate of 0.4\%.
Conclusion: An 'incidence flag' is essential to identify those adverse events for which a hospital has unambiguous responsibility. Using such a flag, secondary analysis of administrative data can provide hospital quality assurance programmes with a comprehensive view of all adverse events (not just 'sentinel' events) at a reasonable cost and with more timely results than more intensive methods can achieve. Although the method is likely to underestimate the true rate of adverse events (in particular, by not capturing adverse events which only manifest after discharge), in this study of Australian hospitals, rates of adverse events were found to be similar to those derived from studies using manual review of patient records.},

We quantify influenza’s contribution to the combined pneumonia and influenza mortality time series for the United States, 1959–2009. A key statistic is I/(P+I), the proportion of pneumonia and influenza mortality accounted for by influenza. Year-to-year, I/(P+I) is highly variable and shows long-term decline. Extreme values of I/(P+I) are associated with extreme P+I death rates and vice-versa, but I/(P+I) is a weak predictor of P+I mortality overall. Prominence of influenza in the medical news is associated with high I/(P+I). Influenza and pneumonia should be analyzed as a combined cause.},

	abstract = {The United States has experienced three medical malpractice (med mal) crises in the past 40 years. In response, 31 states now have caps on noneconomic or total damages. Researchers have studied the impact of these caps, relative to control states without caps, but have not studied trends in no-cap states or overall national trends. We find that the per-physician rate of paid med mal claims has been dropping for 20 years and in 2012 was less than half the 1992 level. Lawsuit rates, in the states with available data, are also declining, at similar rates. “Small” paid claims (payout {\textless} \$50,000 in 2011 dollars) have been dropping for the full period; “large” paid claims (payout ≥ \$50,000) have been dropping since 2001. Payout per large paid claim was roughly flat. Payouts per physician have been dropping since 2003, and by 2012 were 48 percent below their 1992 level. The “third wave” of damage cap adoptions over 2003–2006 contributed to this trend, but there are also large declines in no-cap states.},

Applying empirical Bayes methods in a regression setting, we construct a predictor of each physician's underlying propensity to incur malpractice claims. Our explanatory factors are physician demographics (age, sex, specialty, training) and physician practice pattern characteristics (practice setting, procedures performed, practice intensity, special risk factors, and characteristics of hospital(s) on staff of). We divide physicians into medical and surgical/ancillary specialty categories and fit separate models to each. In the surgical/ancillary specialty group, physician characteristics can effectively distinguish between more and less claims-prone physicians. Physician characteristics have somewhat less predictive power in the medical specialty group. As measured by predictive information, physician characteristics are superior to 10 years of claims history. Insofar as medical malpractice claims can be thought of as extreme indicators of poor-quality care, this finding suggests that easily gathered physician characteristics can be helpful in designing targeted quality of care improvement policies.},

Rather than associating standardization with totalizing narratives of globalization or dehumanization, we call for careful empirical analysis of the specific and unintended consequences of different sorts of standards operating in distinct social domains.},
