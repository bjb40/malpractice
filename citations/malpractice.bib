	abstract = {Objective: To compare two methods for identifying adverse events using routinely recorded hospital abstract data in all public and private hospitals in Victoria, Australia.
Methods: Secondary analysis of data on all admissions in the period 1 July 2000–30 June 2001 (n = 1,645,992) to estimate the rates of adverse events using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision Australian Modification codes alone and in combination with an 'incidence' data flag indicating complicating diagnoses which arise after hospitalization; rates of incidence and pre-existing adverse events, and rates for same-day and multi-day admissions.
Results: In total, 8\% of all admissions were recorded with an adverse event. Use of ICD codes alone identified only 59\% of the events identified using the combined method, giving a prevalence rate of only 5\%. Incident cases, that is, those occurring in the index admission, represented 68\% of identified adverse events. The adverse events incidence rate for multi-day admissions was significantly higher at 12\%, compared with the same day rate of 0.4\%.
Conclusion: An 'incidence flag' is essential to identify those adverse events for which a hospital has unambiguous responsibility. Using such a flag, secondary analysis of administrative data can provide hospital quality assurance programmes with a comprehensive view of all adverse events (not just 'sentinel' events) at a reasonable cost and with more timely results than more intensive methods can achieve. Although the method is likely to underestimate the true rate of adverse events (in particular, by not capturing adverse events which only manifest after discharge), in this study of Australian hospitals, rates of adverse events were found to be similar to those derived from studies using manual review of patient records.},

We compared three methods to detect adverse events in hospitalized patients, using the same patient sample set from three leading hospitals. We found that the adverse event detection methods commonly used to track patient safety in the United States today—voluntary reporting and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Patient Safety Indicators—fared very poorly compared to other methods and missed 90 percent of the adverse events. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Global Trigger Tool found at least ten times more confirmed, serious events than these other methods. Overall, adverse events occurred in one-third of hospital admissions. Reliance on voluntary reporting and the Patient Safety Indicators could produce misleading conclusions about the current safety of care in the US health care system and misdirect efforts to improve patient safety.},

	abstract = {Tort reform has been a hot issue during the past decade, as malpractice premiums spiked, and state and federal legislators debated the desirability of damages caps. Nine states adopted caps on non-economic or total damages during the period 2003-2006, joining twenty-two states that had previously adopted caps. Great effort has been devoted to studying the impact of these caps, but overall trends in claim rates and payouts have been ignored. Using the National Practitioner Data Bank, we find the frequency of paid medical malpractice claims per physician has been dropping steadily for almost 20 years, and is now less than half the level it was in 1992. Payouts per physician have also been dropping since 2003, and are now 46\% below their 1992 level. The decline is largest in states that recently capped total or non-economic damages, but there are also large and sustained declines in states with older damage caps and states with no damage caps. We identify several factors that may partially explain these trends, and suggest possibilities for further research.},

Researchers have studied the impact of these caps, relative to control states without caps, but have not studied trends in no-cap states or overall national trends. We find that the per-physician rate of paid med mal claims has been dropping for 20 years and in 2012 was less than half the 1992 level. Lawsuit rates, in the states with available data, are also declining, at similar rates. “Small” paid claims (payout {\textless} \$50,000 in 2011 dollars) have been dropping for the full period; “large” paid claims (payout ≥ \$50,000) have been dropping since 2001. Payout per large paid claim was roughly flat. Payouts per physician have been dropping since 2003, and by 2012 were 48 percent below their 1992 level. The “third wave” of damage cap adoptions over 2003–2006 contributed to this trend, but there are also large declines in no-cap states.},

Our safety measures are 17 adult Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) – measures developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of adverse events, many of which are avoidable.  We find strong correlations among most PSIs:  hospitals with high rates on one PSI usually have high rates on other PSIs.  We also find a strong association between PSI rates and med mal claim rates.  A pooled measure of PSI rates predicts higher claim rates in hospital fixed effects specifications (in Florida) and county-fixed effects specifications (in Texas).  Our results suggest that, contrary to the views of many health care providers, med mal claims that lead to payouts are not a random event.  Instead, hospitals that improve patient safety can reduce med mal payouts.We also study local variation in patient safety, in the spirit of the Dartmouth Atlas work on variation in treatment intensity.  We find large variations, both across counties and across hospitals within counties.  This suggests that many adverse hospital events are avoidable at reasonable cost, since some hospitals are avoiding them.},
